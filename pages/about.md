# **Hello everyone!** 

### About me

**{{ site.author.name }}** is a Computer Science student who aims to be personally and professionally better, each day. She is skilled in Web Development and programming and supports open source software. She is also involved with tech communities like Mozilla Karnataka, Mozilla India, WTM Bangalore, WomenWhoGo Bangalore and LeanIn Women in Tech India. She is a trained Kathak dancer and has attained a Visharad (diploma) in the same. She loves to read and write. Music instills joy in her life. She is introverted but speaks her mind whenever required. She would love to party inside and only with three of her good friends. She faces trouble choosing between amazing options and combinations like tea and coffee, dogs and cats, Dhoni and Kohli, Badminton and Basketball, Ice-creams and Cakes and.... actually, this list is a little long. But she makes up her mind and sticks to her decisions, after giving it a lot of thought. She is opinionated but tries to be the least judgemental person in the room. She is confidently weird.

P.S. Also, the above was written by me and could've been in first person but writing a description about yourself in third person is a really fun thing to do.
