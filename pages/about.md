# **Hello everyone!** 

### About me

Hi, I am Srishti. I am an Engineering graduate looking for work to find a purpose which can keep me motivated and fulfilled. I have a genuine interest in working with technologies and products that make people's lives easier. During the course of my student life, I loved meeting new people and listening to their stories which created my interest in working with communities around tech inclusivity and open source. I spend my free time in reading and writing and I am always in search of good music. Oh and, I can dance well. Thanks for being here!
