# **Hello everyone!** 

### About me

**{{ site.author.name }}** is a Computer Science student who aims to be personally and professionally better, each day. She is skilled in Web Development and programming and supports open-source software. She is also involved with tech communities like Mozilla Karnataka, Mozilla India, WTM Bangalore, WomenWhoGo Bangalore and LeanIn Women in Tech India. She is a trained Kathak dancer and has attained a Visharad (diploma) in the same. She loves to read and write. Music instills joy in her life. She is introverted but speaks her mind whenever required. She likes to party inside only with her close friends. It is trouble for her to choose between amazing options like tea and coffee, dogs and cats, Dhoni and Kohli, Badminton and Basketball, Ice-creams and Cakes and.... actually, this list is a little long. However, once she makes up her mind after giving proper thought, she sticks to her decisions. She is opinionated but tries to be least judgemental. She is confidently weird.

P.S. Also, the above was written by me and could've been in first person but writing a description about yourself in third person is a really fun thing to do.
