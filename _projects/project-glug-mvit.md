A static blog website developed using Jekyll with a team of enthusiastic developers. My main task was to work on the front end development part along with a couple of other members of the club. The GitHub repository for the same is [here](https://github.com/glugmvit/glugmvit.github.io). The finished product looks something like [this](https://blog.glugmvit.com/). 

I also wrote a few blogs for the same. Do check them out [here](https://blog.glugmvit.com/author-srishti-nema).
