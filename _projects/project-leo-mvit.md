This project was made with a team of Leonites (members of LEO, as we fondly call each other) for our club. It is an amazing place for writers, readers and all language enthusiasts. The code is available [here](https://github.com/leomvit/leomvit.github.io). It is made using Jekyll. Visit it [here](https://leomvit.com/).
